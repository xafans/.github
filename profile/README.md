# 🌞 Welcome to Xafans

> Building the tools we use and sharing them with you.

We’re a small group of passionate developers crafting **open-source libraries** that make modern development simpler, clearer, and more reliable.  
Every library we create is something we **use ourselves in production** then polish, document, and open up for others.

---

## 💡 What We Do

- 🧩 Develop **essential, lightweight libraries** for everyday use  
- 💻 Focus on **TypeScript**, **modern browsers**, and **developer experience**  
- 🧠 Keep our work **minimal, well-typed, and dependency-free** whenever possible  
- 🤝 Share our internal tools as **public building blocks** for the community

## 🧭 Our Philosophy

We believe in **clarity**, **openness**, and **craftsmanship**.  
Good software is built not only for scale, but for **humans** who read, use, and learn from it.  
That’s why every repo in this organization is designed with:

- Clean, readable source  
- Full TypeScript support  
- Thoughtful naming and documentation  
- Real-world practicality
